# [SAVIOR II Study: Non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) for the Prophylaxis and Treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in COVID-19 Patients](https://github.com/domcontestabile/Dom_Portfolio/blob/main/SaviorII_study_statistics_code)

Objective: Investigate whether non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) can reduce respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients, who were admitted to Allegheny General Hospital in 2020. Assess the effectiveness of nVNS in improving respiratory symptoms, reducing inflammation, and enhancing cardiopulmonary outcomes, with the goal of potentially using nVNS as a non-invasive and easy-to-administer therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Programming: SAS

Overview:
- Recoded new labels on already exisiting variables
- Utilized two-sample t tests and Fisherâ€™s exact tests to determine any significant relationships between patient treatment group and continuous and categorical variables, respectively  
- Observed a significant difference (p<0.05) between average patient PaO2/FiO2 (or P/F) ratios and their treatment group
- Created a Table 1 of study patient descriptive statistics 
- Created a boxplot to visually show the signifcant difference between average patient P/F ratios and their treatment group

# [COVID-19 State-level Changes in Positive Cases Between States with Early and Delayed Removal of Social Distancing Restrictions in 2020 Report](https://github.com/domcontestabile/Dom_Portfolio/blob/main/COVID19_State_level_Changes_during_2020)

Objective: Compare the trajectory of positive cases between states that aggressively relaxed distancing restrictions in mid-May 2020 and states that delayed such measures. Assess whether there were changes in the case hospitalization rate (CHR) from early in the pandemic to later, considering potential factors such as underlying severity and/or the evolution of clinical management.

Programming: SAS

Overview:
- Merged state population/re-opening approach dataset with state covid cases/hospitalizations/deaths dataset
- Calculated descriptive statistics and a box plot for the number of positive cases per capita by time (April vs. December) and re-opening approach (early vs. delayed)
- Computed a mixed effect regression model of positive cases per capita (100,000 cases/population) on re-opening approach 
- Calculated descriptive statistics for case hospitalization rate (CHR), defined as 100 * (total hospitalizations in a month / total positive cases in a month) during April 2020, December 2020, and the change in CHR within states (December minus April)
- Assessed whether the change in CHR within states was statistically significantly different than 0 using a paired t-test.

# [Stryker Spine Observational Trial of Clinical Outcomes following Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion with Instrumentation using Allograft or Tritanium - Retrospective Patient Statistics](https://github.com/domcontestabile/Dom_Portfolio/blob/main/Stryker_Spine_Implant_Retrospective_Study_Patients)

Objective: To compare the rate of fusion success and adverse events, patients who undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) utilizing Tritanium C (Stryker Spine) will be retrospectively compared to a sample of 20 former patients. Create descriptive statistics for the 20 retrospective patients who underwent instrumented ACDF utilizing structural allograft bone with plates.

Programming: SAS

Overview:
- Calculated descriptive statistics for the retrospective patient sample's continuous and categorical variables (continuous: age, weight, height, & BMI; categorical: sex, race, ethnicity, treated cervical index level, diagnosis, & smoking status)

# [NY Citi Bike Data Analysis Project](https://secure-web.cisco.com/1wJiRYOwgAdWiqq5q-HGfiwA5vFwWywHs3tGlPaNAbGiideu-DxiMNS8Nf6r6zvrOfwy2Zlassc9bBOx_vspSUls0jlmXEPtBJaDn5g4ymP7bcDqluJ0rhDk-hrO6_GeNRoXxuswuQrXtwgvPizp24NQlPHNibirFIxc-axXJFKjXQ9GS0GClRhRgVh4U3V3A5yoIHHedujTJFN6yf_4TZCgzEblhEQsmPqOYLLauAbj1_wWuch_NaJiJC-pwdO6KJ_SQ2u4jO2whgspWzcMZp-BJX5RkyulE01bnUEbAaYZ7iCyvTeAa6BMku7WXuI7N/https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1XlpHhsr8NQSZBynY95BAMer_1cFC3vZExQeeWlrOZ6I%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing)

Objective: Practice the role of a data analyst and work with a real dataset (sourced from Kaggle) to solve a hypothetical business challenge. For the purposes of this project, I chose to analyze a dataset from a bike-sharing company, known as Citi Bike. Answer the following questions to help key stakeholders to make smart, data-driven decisions based on the insights I uncover:

1. What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for NY Citi Bike rental?
2. How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
3. Which age group rents the most bikes?
4. How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
5. Does user age impact the average bike trip duration?

Programming: Google Sheets

Overview:
- Cleaned a NY Citi Bike dataset, removed duplicates, and handled missing data
- Conducted an exploratory data analysis, calculated descriptive statistics, and created pivot tables in order to better understand the data
- Created data visualizations in order to summarize and present key findings in a concise and accessible format
- Crafted a polished, professional presentation, ready to share with stakeholders
