derive for each month within each state:
- per capita rates for each of the COVID metrics (= 100,000 *(metric/population) rounded to the second decimal place)
- case hospitalization rate (CHR = 100 * (hospitalizations / positive cases) rounded to the second decimal place)
- Keep the following variables: state, month, reopen status, per capita COVID metrics, and CHR

Serial by STATE
-Transpose the STATE/MONTH dataset such that there are new variables for CHR in specific months
-Calculate the change (= December - April)
Keep the following variables: state, CHR in April, CHR in December, change in CHR */

/***************************** ANALYSIS ASSIGNMENT **********************************

Summary:
Using the COVID tracking data, provide summary statistics across all states / DC for the following:

- Per capita positive cases in the early vs. delayed reopening states for both April and December.
- Case hospitalization rates in April, December, and the change from April to December
Make sure all output is clearly labelled / titled. */
